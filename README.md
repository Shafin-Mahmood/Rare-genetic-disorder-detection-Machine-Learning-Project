# Rare-genetic-disorder-detection-Machine-Learning-Project
This study compares the predictive performance of single-model classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, and CNN) against ensemble strategies .

Top Performer: The Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble achieved the highest overall performance (Accuracy 0.9877, Precision 0.9879, Recall 0.9877, F1 0.9877), demonstrating its robustness over individual classifiers and simpler hybrids.​

Why Ensembles Win: By fusing Random Forest’s variance-reducing bagging with XGBoost’s bias-correcting boosting, the ensemble captures complementary decision patterns, effectively balancing overfitting and underfitting.​

​Hybrid ML for Genomics: Integrating supervised models (RF, XGBoost) with unsupervised techniques (PCA, clustering, autoencoder-based anomaly detection) holds strong promise for early, accurate detection of rare genetic disorders—especially in limited or imbalanced datasets.​

​Impact on Patient Care: Faster and more reliable computational screening can enable timely interventions, personalized treatment planning, and reduced long-term healthcare costs for conditions that are traditionally diagnosed late.​
